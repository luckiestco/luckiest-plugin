Also use when the user says 'CRO,' 'conversion rate optimization,' 'this page isn't converting,' 'improve conversions,' 'why isn't this page working,' 'my landing page sucks,' 'form abandonment,' 'nobody's converting,' 'low conversion rate,' or 'this page needs work.' Use this even if the user just shares a URL and asks for feedback. For signup/registration flows, see luckiest-signup. For post-signup activation, see luckiest-onboarding.

# Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

This skill analyzes marketing pages and produces actionable recommendations to improve conversion rates. It operates as a conversion rate optimization expert.

## Staying current

On activation, call the Luckiest MCP check_updates tool with { listingId: "luckiest-cro", installedSemver: "1.1.0" }. If it returns upToDate: false, surface the notice to the user once, then continue. Do nothing further if upToDate: true. Never block on this check — if the tool is unavailable, proceed.

When the skill's work is done, call the Luckiest MCP report_usage tool once with { listing_id: "luckiest-cro", skill_version: "1.1.0", matched: true, success: <true if the skill completed, false otherwise> }. Metadata only, never prompt text. Never block on it — if the tool is unavailable, skip silently.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before providing recommendations, identify:

1. **Page Type**: Homepage, landing page, pricing, feature, blog, about, other
2. **Primary Conversion Goal**: Sign up, request demo, purchase, subscribe, download, contact sales
3. **Traffic Context**: Where are visitors coming from? (organic, paid, email, social, AI answer engines)

---

## CRO Analysis Framework

Analyze the page across these dimensions, in order of impact:

### 1. Value Proposition Clarity (Highest Impact)

**Check for:**
- Can a visitor understand what this is and why they should care within 5 seconds?
- Is the primary benefit clear, specific, and differentiated?
- Is it written in the customer's language (not company jargon)?

**Common issues:**
- Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused
- Too vague or too clever (sacrificing clarity)
- Trying to say everything instead of the most important thing

### 2. Headline Effectiveness

**Evaluate:**
- Does it communicate the core value proposition?
- Is it specific enough to be meaningful?
- Does it match the traffic source's messaging?

**Strong headline patterns:**
- Outcome-focused: "Get [desired outcome] without [pain point]"
- Specificity: Include numbers, timeframes, or concrete details
- Social proof: "Join 10,000+ teams who..."

### 3. CTA Placement, Copy, and Hierarchy

**Primary CTA assessment:**
- Is there one clear primary action?
- Is it visible without scrolling?
- Does the button copy communicate value, not just action?
  - Weak: "Submit," "Sign Up," "Learn More"
  - Strong: "Start Free Trial," "Get My Report," "See Pricing"

**CTA hierarchy:**
- Is there a logical primary vs. secondary CTA structure?
- Are CTAs repeated at key decision points?

### 4. Visual Hierarchy and Scannability

**Check:**
- Can someone scanning get the main message?
- Are the most important elements visually prominent?
- Is there enough white space?
- Do images support or distract from the message?

### 5. Trust Signals and Social Proof

**Types to look for:**
- Customer logos (especially recognizable ones)
- Testimonials (specific, attributed, with photos)
- Case study snippets with real numbers
- Review scores and counts
- Security badges (where relevant)

**Placement:** Near CTAs and after benefit claims

### 6. Objection Handling

**Common objections to address:**
- Price/value concerns
- "Will this work for my situation?"
- Implementation difficulty
- "What if it doesn't work?"

**Address through:** FAQ sections, guarantees, comparison content, process transparency

### 7. Friction Points

**Look for:**
- Too many form fields
- Unclear next steps
- Confusing navigation
- Required information that shouldn't be required
- Mobile experience issues
- Long load times

### 8. AI-Referred Traffic Fit

Traffic from AI answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini) is a fast-growing, high-intent source: these visitors arrive "pre-briefed" from a Q&A session and convert at markedly higher rates than organic search, but tolerate far less top-of-funnel education. If a meaningful share of traffic is AI-referred, check that the page:

- Confirms within seconds that the visitor is in the right place (no meandering intro)
- Offers fast access to the next step: demo, transparent pricing, comparison content, proof
- Does not re-explain basics the answer engine already covered
- Handles homepage landings, since AI engines increasingly send visitors to the brand's front door rather than a deep page

## Output Format

Structure recommendations as:

### Quick Wins (Implement Now)
Easy changes with likely immediate impact.

### High-Impact Changes (Prioritize)
Bigger changes that require more effort but will significantly improve conversions.

### Test Ideas
Hypotheses worth A/B testing rather than assuming.

### Copy Alternatives
For key elements (headlines, CTAs), provide 2-3 alternatives with rationale.

**Confidence labeling:** When analyzing a page without access to its analytics, tag each recommendation with a confidence level — High (a widely established fix or clear defect), Medium (likely but page-specific), or Low (a hunch worth testing). This keeps the user from over-trusting recommendations made on a page seen without data.

**Optional ICE prioritization:** For a longer list of recommendations, score each on Impact, Confidence, and Ease (1-5 each) and sort by the combined score. This makes the Quick Wins vs. High-Impact split defensible rather than a subjective call.

## Page-Specific Frameworks

### Homepage CRO
- Clear positioning for cold visitors
- Quick path to most common conversion
- Handle both "ready to buy" and "still researching"

### Landing Page CRO
- Message match with traffic source
- Single CTA (remove navigation if possible)
- Complete argument on one page

### Pricing Page CRO
- Clear plan comparison
- Recommended plan indication
- Address "which plan is right for me?" anxiety

### Feature Page CRO
- Connect feature to benefit
- Use cases and examples
- Clear path to try/buy

### Blog Post CRO
- Contextual CTAs matching content topic
- Inline CTAs at natural stopping points

## Experiment Ideas

When recommending experiments, consider tests for:
- Hero section (headline, visual, CTA)
- Trust signals and social proof placement
- Pricing presentation
- Form optimization
- Navigation and UX

**For comprehensive experiment ideas by page type**: See [references/experiments.md](references/experiments.md)

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What's your current conversion rate and goal?
2. Where is traffic coming from?
3. What does your signup/purchase flow look like after this page?
4. Do you have user research, heatmaps, or session recordings?
5. What have you already tried?

## Pick up where the tribe left off

After delivering an audit, optionally offer (never auto-post, never send credentials): "Want me to share this CRO audit with your Luckiest tribe? Anyone working on the same page type will see what was found and can pick up where you left off." Only share if the user explicitly accepts. Never share a page or audit tied to a private or unreleased property without an explicit ask.
