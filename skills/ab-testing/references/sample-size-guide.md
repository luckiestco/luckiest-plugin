## Sample Size Fundamentals

### Required Inputs

1. **Baseline conversion rate**: Your current rate
2. **Minimum detectable effect (MDE)**: Smallest change worth detecting
3. **Statistical significance level**: Usually 95% (α = 0.05)
4. **Statistical power**: Usually 80% (β = 0.20)

### What These Mean

**Baseline conversion rate**: If your page converts at 5%, that's your baseline.

**MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect)**: The smallest improvement you care about detecting. Set this based on:
- Business impact (is a 5% lift meaningful?)
- Implementation cost (worth the effort?)
- Realistic expectations (what have past tests shown?)

**Statistical significance (95%)**: Means there's less than 5% chance the observed difference is due to random chance.

**Statistical power (80%)**: Means if there's a real effect of size MDE, you have 80% chance of detecting it.

## Duration Calculator

### Formula

```
Duration (days) = (Sample per variant × Number of variants) / (Daily traffic × % exposed)
```

### Examples

**Scenario 1: High-traffic page**
- Need: 10,000 per variant (2 variants = 20,000 total)
- Daily traffic: 5,000 visitors
- 100% exposed to test
- Duration: 20,000 / 5,000 = **4 days**

**Scenario 2: Medium-traffic page**
- Need: 30,000 per variant (60,000 total)
- Daily traffic: 2,000 visitors
- 100% exposed
- Duration: 60,000 / 2,000 = **30 days**

**Scenario 3: Low-traffic with partial exposure**
- Need: 15,000 per variant (30,000 total)
- Daily traffic: 500 visitors
- 50% exposed to test
- Effective daily: 250
- Duration: 30,000 / 250 = **120 days** (too long!)

### Minimum Duration Rules

Even with sufficient sample size, run tests for at least:
- **1 full week**: To capture day-of-week variation
- **2 business cycles**: If B2B (weekday vs. weekend patterns)
- **Through paydays**: If e-commerce (beginning/end of month)

### Maximum Duration Guidelines

Avoid running tests longer than 4-8 weeks:
- Novelty effects wear off
- External factors intervene
- Opportunity cost of other tests

## Adjusting for Multiple Variants

With more than 2 variants (A/B/n tests), you need more sample:

| Variants | Multiplier |
|----------|------------|
| 2 (A/B) | 1x |
| 3 (A/B/C) | ~1.5x |
| 4 (A/B/C/D) | ~2x |
| 5+ | Consider reducing variants |

**Why?** More comparisons increase chance of false positives. You're comparing:
- A vs B
- A vs C
- B vs C (sometimes)

Apply Bonferroni correction or use tools that handle this automatically.

## Common Sample Size Mistakes

### 1. Underpowered tests
**Problem**: Not enough sample to detect realistic effects
**Fix**: Be realistic about MDE, get more traffic, or don't test

### 2. Overpowered tests
**Problem**: Waiting for sample size when you already have significance
**Fix**: This is actually fine—you committed to sample size, honor it

### 3. Wrong baseline rate
**Problem**: Using wrong conversion rate for calculation
**Fix**: Use the specific metric and page, not site-wide averages

### 4. Ignoring segments
**Problem**: Calculating for full traffic, then analyzing segments
**Fix**: If you plan segment analysis, calculate sample for smallest segment

### 5. Testing too many things
**Problem**: Dividing traffic too many ways
**Fix**: Prioritize ruthlessly, run fewer concurrent tests

## When Sample Size Requirements Are Too High

Options when you can't get enough traffic:

1. **Increase MDE**: Accept only detecting larger effects (20%+ lift)
2. **Lower confidence**: Use 90% instead of 95% (risky, document it)
3. **Reduce variants**: Test only the most promising variant
4. **Combine traffic**: Test across multiple similar pages
5. **Test upstream**: Test earlier in funnel where traffic is higher
6. **Reduce variance with CUPED**: If your tool supports it, CUPED can tighten confidence intervals without more traffic (see below)
7. **Don't test**: Make decision based on qualitative data instead
8. **Longer test**: Accept longer duration (weeks/months)

**Low-traffic default**: If the sample-size tables put you at 60+ days for any realistic MDE, do not default to a classic fixed-horizon frequentist test. Steer instead toward a Bayesian or sequential approach, variance reduction (CUPED), or an honest qualitative decision. Grinding a fixed-horizon test for months on thin traffic is the most common way low-traffic teams waste a quarter.

## Sequential Testing

If you must check results before reaching sample size:

### What is it?
Statistical method that adjusts for multiple looks at data. Modern implementations use anytime-valid confidence sequences, which preserve the Type I error guarantee even under continuous monitoring (the approach Netflix and others have popularized).

### When to use
- High-risk changes
- Need to stop bad variants early
- Time-sensitive decisions
- Low-traffic sites where a fixed horizon is impractical

### Tools that support it
- Optimizely (Stats Accelerator)
- VWO (SmartStats)
- PostHog (Bayesian approach)
- GrowthBook (sequential / Bayesian engines)

### Tradeoff
- More flexibility to stop early
- Slightly larger sample size requirement
- More complex analysis

## Variance Reduction (CUPED)

CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) uses each user's pre-experiment behavior to predict their post-experiment outcome, then measures only the residual difference. By removing predictable variance, it shrinks confidence intervals without collecting more data. Microsoft reported one team's CUPED gain as roughly equivalent to adding 20% more traffic to their experiments.

**When it helps most**: metrics with a strong pre-period correlate (revenue per user, sessions, engagement), and traffic-constrained programs that need faster reads. Supported natively in several modern platforms (e.g., GrowthBook, Statsig, Eppo). If your tool offers it, enable it before resorting to longer tests.

## Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)

SRM is a data-quality failure where the observed traffic split deviates from the intended split (e.g., you planned 50/50 but observe 48/52). It signals a broken randomization, redirect, bot-filtering, or instrumentation bug — and when present, it invalidates the whole result no matter how significant the metrics look.

- **Prevalence**: roughly 6-10% of A/B tests. Microsoft has reported ~6% of large-scale experiments; LinkedIn ~10% of triggered analyses; Booking.com, Yahoo, and Airbnb have published comparable findings.
- **How to check**: run a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test comparing observed vs. expected counts per variant. A p-value below ~0.01 means SRM is present.
- **The rule**: check SRM BEFORE looking at any metric. If it fails, STOP — do not interpret results. Investigate and fix the randomization/instrumentation, then rerun. No exceptions.
- **Common causes**: redirect-based split URL tests dropping users, bot traffic hitting one variant, variant-specific load failures, delayed instrumentation firing, unequal caching.
- **Tooling**: many platforms now monitor SRM automatically (e.g., VWO SmartStats, AB Tasty, Kameleoon).

## Quick Decision Framework

### Can I run this test?

```
Daily traffic to page: _____
Baseline conversion rate: _____
MDE I care about: _____

Sample needed per variant: _____ (from tables above)
Days to run: Sample / Daily traffic = _____

If days > 60: Consider alternatives (Bayesian/sequential, CUPED, or qualitative)
If days > 30: Acceptable for high-impact tests
If days < 14: Likely feasible
If days < 7: Easy to run, consider running longer anyway
```
