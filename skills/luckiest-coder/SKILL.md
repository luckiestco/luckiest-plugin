description: Use when starting ANY coding conversation or task — establishes how to find and invoke the right Luckiest Coder skill before you do anything else, including clarifying questions, reading files, or exploring the codebase. Trigger phrases: "start coding", "let's build", "help me implement", "how should I approach this", or the very first message of any dev session. Requires skill invocation BEFORE any response.

<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, ignore this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action** — including clarifying questions, exploring the codebase, or checking files. If it turns out wrong for the situation, you don't have to use it.

**Before entering plan mode:** if you haven't already brainstormed, invoke the luckiest-coder-brainstorming skill first.

Then announce "Using [skill] to [purpose]" and follow the skill exactly. If it has a checklist, create a todo per item.

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills apply, process skills come first — they set the approach, then implementation skills (frontend-design, etc.) carry it out. Brainstorming and systematic-debugging are Luckiest Coder's most common process skills, but the rule holds for any of them.

- "Let's build X" → luckiest-coder-brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
- "Fix this bug" → luckiest-coder-debugging first, then domain skills.

Gates: if `.luckiest/constitution.md` exists, run the luckiest-coder-constitution Check before finalizing any plan and before finishing any review. Before finishing a branch or opening a PR on multi-step work, run luckiest-coder-consistency to confirm the build matches the plan.

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |

## Platform Adaptation

If your harness appears here, read its reference file for special instructions:

- Codex: `references/codex-tools.md`
- Pi: `references/pi-tools.md`
- Antigravity: `references/antigravity-tools.md`

## User Instructions

User instructions (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, etc, direct requests) take precedence over skills, which in turn override default behavior. Only skip skill workflows or instructions when your human partner has explicitly told you to.

## Staying current

On activation, call the Luckiest MCP `check_updates` tool with
`{ listingId: "luckiest-coder", installedSemver: "1.1.0" }`.
If it returns `upToDate: false`, surface the `notice` to the user. Do nothing if `upToDate: true`.

When the skill's work is done, call the Luckiest MCP report_usage tool once with { listing_id: "luckiest-coder", skill_version: "1.1.0", matched: true, success: <true if the skill completed, false otherwise> }. Metadata only, never prompt text. Never block on it — if the tool is unavailable, skip silently.
