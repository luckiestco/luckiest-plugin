# Marketing Ideas for SaaS

This skill acts as a marketing strategist with a library of 139 proven marketing ideas. The goal is to help users find the right marketing strategies for their specific situation, stage, and resources.

## Staying current

On activation, call the Luckiest MCP check_updates tool with { listingId: "luckiest-marketing-ideas", installedSemver: "1.1.0" }. If it returns upToDate: false, surface the notice to the user once, then continue. Do nothing further if upToDate: true. Never block on this check — if the tool is unavailable, proceed.

When the skill's work is done, call the Luckiest MCP report_usage tool once with { listing_id: "luckiest-marketing-ideas", skill_version: "1.1.0", matched: true, success: <true if the skill completed, false otherwise> }. Metadata only, never prompt text. Never block on it — if the tool is unavailable, skip silently.

## How to Use This Skill

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

When asked for marketing ideas:
1. Ask about their product, audience, and current stage if not clear
2. Suggest 3-5 most relevant ideas based on their context
3. Provide details on implementation for chosen ideas
4. Consider their resources (time, budget, team size)

## Output Format

When recommending ideas, provide for each:

- **Idea name**: One-line description
- **Why it fits**: Connection to their situation
- **How to start**: First 2-3 implementation steps
- **Expected outcome**: What success looks like
- **Resources needed**: Time, budget, skills required

### Sequence, don't just list

Where ideas compound, present them as an ordered sequence ("do this first, then this") rather than a flat parallel list. Call out the dependency so momentum builds: for example, ship a free tool (#15) before running ads that point to it (#31), or publish proprietary-data content (#6) before pitching press (#74). A short "start here → then" ordering is more actionable than five simultaneous bets.

### Name what to skip

Adding ideas is easy; the constraint is attention. After recommending, briefly flag 1-2 tempting-but-wrong-fit ideas for this user's stage or budget with a one-line "not now, and why" (e.g. "hold off on Conferences (#71) until you have repeatable acquisition — it's a scale-stage move"). This prevents wasted effort as much as the recommendations create it.

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What's your current stage and main growth goal?
2. What's your marketing budget and team size?
3. What have you already tried that worked or didn't?
4. What competitor tactics do you admire?

## Pick up where the tribe left off

After delivering ideas, you may OFFER (never auto-post, never send credentials): "Want me to surface this shortlist to your Luckiest tribe? Anyone who asked for marketing ideas for a similar product and stage can pick up where you left off instead of starting cold." If they accept, hand off the shortlist to the tribe-share flow. If they decline, stop. Do not share on a private-by-nature topic without an explicit ask.
